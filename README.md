**Small, dependency-light operational tools for AI coding agents.**

A coding agent edits your source, runs your shell, reads whatever files it can reach, and spends money — at machine speed, often unattended. That's a production system, and it needs the same operational layer you'd give anything else with that much reach: recover, prevent, observe, spend, secure, set up, verify.

These are the tools we built filling each gap, one real failure at a time, running autonomous agent fleets on Claude Code in production. Each is a single script (Python 3 or bash), no install, no dependencies beyond a stock interpreter. Each links to a write-up explaining the failure it prevents and the data behind it.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muthuishere/agent-ops
# each tool is self-contained — run it directly:
python3 agent-ops/mcp-budget/mcp-budget .
bash    agent-ops/preflight/preflight

## Tests

Every tool ships a self-contained suite (`<tool>/test_<tool>.sh`) that builds its own
fixtures and exits non-zero on any failure. CI runs all of them on every push and PR —
one green check per tool.

```sh
scripts/run-tests.sh              # run the whole fleet
scripts/run-tests.sh agent-frisk  # run one tool's suite
```

Only `python3` and `bash` are required; a few suites build throwaway git repos.
